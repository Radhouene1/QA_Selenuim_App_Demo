# QA_Selenuim_App_Demo

After failing in an interview, I realised this project in order to highlight my technical skills in test automation frameworks( using python, selenium, pytest, unittest, logging, etc)
And demanding another chance  to recover and do my best.

I was not at all satisfied with my payoff but on the other hand, this experience motivated me to go back to prepare this demo project.
